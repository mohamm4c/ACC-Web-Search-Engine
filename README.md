# ACC-Web-Search-Engine
Project for Advanced Computing Concepts.
For this project, 
we were required to develop a web search engine using at least three concepts;
for example: 
finding patterns using regular expressions,
translation of HTML to text, 
ranking web pages using sorting, 
heaps or other data structures, 
finding keywords using string matching, 
use of inverted index, 
analyzing frequencies of words using hash tables or search trees, 
using large dictionaries/datasets and many others.â€‹
